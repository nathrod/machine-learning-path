# Machine Learning Projects
This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects that I have developed as part of my learning journey in Machine Learning. Each project explores a different aspect of machine learning techniques, including data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

## Projects
1. __Cats vs Dogs Image Classification using Transfer Learning__
   - __Description:__ This project involves using transfer learning to classify images of cats and dogs. Pre-trained models such as InceptionV3 and others will be applied to achieve high accuracy with minimal training time.
   - __Objective:__ Understand transfer learning and how to apply pre-trained models for image classification tasks.
   - __Tools:__ Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Google Colab, Transfer Learning (InceptionV3).
